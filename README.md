# 🚀 Xionxepay — Scan-to-Pay Web3 POS System

**Xionxepay** is a smart, Web3-powered Point-of-Sale (POS) system that allows vendors to accept stablecoin payments through QR codes — no crypto wallets or blockchain knowledge required.

> Built for underserved markets, micro-businesses, and vendors who need **fast, gasless, and user-friendly** digital payment solutions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional payment systems often exclude millions due to:
- Poor banking infrastructure
- Limited access to digital financial tools
- High transaction fees

Meanwhile, Web3 is powerful but **too complex for everyday users**.  
**Xionxepay bridges this gap** by offering a scan-to-pay POS system that combines Web3 power with Web2 simplicity.
